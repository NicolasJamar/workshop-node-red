# Welcome in the node-red workshop !

## Short presentation

TODO

## Installation

- Clone this repository & move into the directory
- start docker `docker-compose up` (it will run node-red & mongodb)

## Security (source : https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/runtime/securing-node-red)

By default, the Node-RED editor is not secured - anyone who can access its IP address can access the editor and deploy changes.

Let's securise it !

You'll need to edit the `settings.js` in the `.node-red`folder...

If you want to go in this folder, you'll need to run the cmd in the docker container:

- get the container name with `docker ps`
